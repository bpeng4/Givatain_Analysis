# Givatain_Analysis

## Purpose

#### Test how human gut microbiota responds to different types of fiber.

## Materials and Methods

#### AiMs, DNA extraction, PCR, Sequencing
#### Data Analysis: 
#### Analize data by subject and find which subject gives us the largest change by checking the beta diversity change from FBB0 on PCA plots.
#### Use statistical models to tract texonomic changes across subjects, especially beneficial changes
 - which statiscial model should be used to fit multiple human microbiome and multiple substrates?
 - Category the substrates into two main classes: Beta-glucans and complex fiber and analysis based on the two categories
 - Do dose responses analysis for gut microbiota by different doses of substrates.

## Results

## Figures and Tables
